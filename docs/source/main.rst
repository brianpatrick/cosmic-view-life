``main()``: Running the Code
*******************************************************************************

Running the processing codes for any particular data set is all coordinated through ``main()``. All other modules and functions are called from the main function, and can be selectively commented out to process whichever portion you'd like to run.

Below are the descriptions of the main module, and all of its functions, which end up generating all the files for this project.


.. module:: main
.. autofunction:: main
