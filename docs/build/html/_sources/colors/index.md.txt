Generating Color Maps
===============================================

There are some tools and color palettes available to generate color maps used for OpenSpace. We adopt a main color sample from the Wikipedia page for crayola crayons, where a list of colors and their hex values are scraped and stored.

This process, theoretically, needs to be run only once, assuming the `chosen_colors` is not altered. Once you run it for the first time, it may be commented out of `main.py`.


## Main Color Palette

The main list of colors is scraped from the standard colors table on [Wikipedia's List of Crayola crayon colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors). This provides the basis of available colors, but note we only include colors with Hexidecimal values.
