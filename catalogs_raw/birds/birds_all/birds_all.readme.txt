Data source: 
   Barcode Of Life Database [ratnasingham2007] COI5-P sequences of birds. 

   sequences were aligned using the mafft software [katoh2002,katoh2013]. 
   The sequence alignment extremities were then trimmed to avoid the spurious gaps resulting from differences in the size of the sequenced fragment. 
   The resulting multiple sequence alignment presented no gaps (-), no missing base (N) characters, and 0.007\% ambiguous IUPAC characters. 
   
   This multiple sequence alignment was then transformed to a numerical high-dimensional representation using pyKleeBarcode [duchemin2023]. 
   
   We first computed indicator vectors at the species scale. We then computed comparable indicator vectors for each individual sequences, but using the species-level representation as references.

   This gave the high-dimensional representations at the species and the sequence levels.


3D projections:
   At the species level, 3D cMDS
   At the sequence level, Gower interpolation on the species 3D cMDS


Files:
   high-dimensional csv:
      - birds_all.species.indicVectors.csv : species-level 
      - birds_all.sequence.indicVectors.csv : sequence-level

   low-dimensional csv:
      - birds_all.species.3DcMDS.csv
      - birds_all.sequence.3DcMDS.csv


   metadata csv:
      - birds_all.seqId2taxon.csv : csv with two columns associating sequence ID to species or subspecies
      - birds_all.taxons.metadata.csv : columns, for each species or subspecies in the primates dataset:
                           taxon : name as it appears in the species-level files
                           species : binomial scientific species name
                           hybrid : is it an hybrid ? True/False
                           subspecies : is it a subspecies ? True/False
                           lineage : comma separated lineage from root to genus (taxonomic entity above species level)
      - birds_all.species_family_annotation.csv : species genus   family  order (grouping is family)
